# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

This is our project for the Statistical Methods in AI course (Monsoon 2023). The project involves doing domain adaptation from a source dataset to a target dataset by introducing a Gradient Reversal Layer.

We adapted the following pairs - 
1. MNIST <-> MNIST-M
2. MNIST <-> USPS
3. MNIST <-> SVHN
4. Amazon -> Webcam
5. Webcam -> DSLR
6. DSLR -> Amazon
7. Quickdraw -> Clipart
8. Sketch <-> Painting
9. MNIST + MNIST-M -> SVHN
